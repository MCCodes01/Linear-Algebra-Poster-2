                <p>I need you to make a visually appealing HTML "poster" for a math info page about spanning sets. I also want you to put references including Lab 3, Claude etc. in compliance with the AI policy I attached.</p>
                <p>The poster should cover each of these thoroughly but efficiently:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Introduction/Rationale – What is the motivation for studying this subject/why is this topic interesting?</li>
                    <li>Objectives–What do you set out to explain?</li>
                    <li>Methods–What tools from abstract algebra are used?</li>
                    <li>Results –What did you learn?</li>
                    <li>Conclusions – What is the significance of this result? Interpret your findings. (What is the main take home point?)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This should be almost like a flashcard of info that's very simplistic to understand. It should also be visually compelling to look at and include graphs, tables or whatever is necessary.</p>

            <div class="content">
                <p>I'll create a visually appealing HTML poster about spanning sets for your linear algebra project, following the wireframe design you provided in Image 1 and incorporating the lab question example from Images 2 and 3. I'll make sure it's comprehensive yet efficient, covering all the topics you mentioned while keeping it visually compelling.</p>

                <p>For the lab question in block 3, team A beat team B, C, D so the arrow should point from A to them. Then team D only beat team B, team C beat both B and D.</p>
                <p>Also I think we can make this more visually appealing like add some different coloring into the title section.</p>
                <p>Also I will need to have a link to the second page of the site in the references that will be of our chat logs that I will download.</p>

                <p>I've made all the requested updates to the spanning sets poster:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Corrected the directed graph in block 3:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Now accurately shows Team A beating Teams B, C, and D</li>
                            <li>Team C beating Teams B and D</li>
                            <li>Team D beating only Team B</li>
                            <li>Added color coding to make the relationships clearer</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Enhanced the visual appeal of the title section:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Added a colorful gradient background (blue, purple, green)</li>
                            <li>Increased the title font size and added a subtle shadow effect</li>
                            <li>Added a subtitle for additional context</li>
                            <li>Included a box shadow for depth</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Added a link to the chat logs:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Created a styled link in the references section that points to "conversation_logs.html"</li>
                            <li>This link is designed to match the overall aesthetic of the poster</li>
                            <li>This will allow you to link to the downloaded chat logs as requested</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>The poster now more accurately represents the Lab 3 information while maintaining a clean, visually engaging design. The team relationship graph is color-coded to make it easier to follow the wins and losses between teams.</p>

                <p>The "Page not found" error should be resolved once you upload both files to your GitHub Pages repository. Make sure both files are:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>In the same directory (root of your repository)</li>
                    <li>Named exactly as specified:

                            <li><code>index.html</code> for the poster</li>

                </ol>
                <p>If you're still experiencing the issue after uploading both files, check that:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>GitHub Pages is properly enabled for your repository</li>
                    <li>You're waiting for GitHub to build and deploy your site (which can take a few minutes)</li>
                    <li>Both files have the correct permissions</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Also, remember that GitHub Pages is case-sensitive, so ensure the filenames and links match exactly in capitalization as well.</p>

                <p>I've also improved the styling to better display these images with proper containers, headings, and formatting. This provides a more complete record of our conversation, showing all the materials you shared at the beginning.</p>
                <p>When you upload this updated logs.html file to your GitHub Pages repository along with the index.html file, both should work correctly with the link between them functioning properly.</p>
